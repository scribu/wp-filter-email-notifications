Stop WordPress from sending email notifications for comments that have been manually approved.

== Description ==

**Scenario**

You're the only user who can create posts and moderate comments on your WordPress installation.

You have both 'Email me when anyone posts a comment' and 'Email me when a comment is held for moderation' options checked.

You get an email about a comment awaiting moderation and you approve it.

The problem is that right after that you get a second email letting you know that a new comment has been posted, which of course you already knew about.

**Solution**

Instead of disabling email notifications for new comments alltogether, you can use this plugin and not receive the redundant emails mentioned above.

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed in 2 easy steps:

1. Unzip "Filter Email Notifications" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
